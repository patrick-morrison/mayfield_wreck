Testing the New York Times 3D Scene Controls

Modified version of Option 2 here: https://rd.nytimes.com/projects/delivering-3d-scenes-to-the-web

Option uses a glb put together from sketchfab gltf.
Camera exported from blender, with each keyframe the X angle turned down by 90 degrees (not sure how to overcome this...)
